# presto_HPC

This is an adapted script from pRESTO (https://presto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I basically modified the input names from the "UMI Barcoded Illumina MiSeq 325+275 paired-end 5â€™RACE BCR mRNA" pipeline  (https://presto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows/VanderHeiden2017_Workflow.html) so it can be run in parallel with other sequencing runs.
